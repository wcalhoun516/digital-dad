# Daily log

Working memory for the daily product-dev agent (`scripts/daily_routine_prompt.md`).

---

## How to add ideas

You have three ways to influence what the agent builds, in **priority order** (the agent
prefers earlier ones):

1. **Pre-baked plan (hot path, highest priority).** Drop a `NNNN-slug.md` implementation plan
   into [`plans/ready/`](plans/ready/). The agent executes the *oldest* one first via the
   `superpowers:executing-plans` skill, then moves it to `plans/done/`. Best for work you've
   already thought through.
2. **User pin (middle priority).** Add a line under `## User pins` below. The agent works the
   **first unchecked `[ ]`** pin. Best for "just do this next" without writing a full plan.
3. **Roadmap (cold path, lowest priority).** Add/raise an item in
   [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md). When there's no plan and no pin, the agent picks the
   least-recently-worked category and pulls the highest-priority item from it.

The agent opens **one small draft PR per day**, never merges, never pushes to `main`. Review
the PR during the day; merge it yourself if you're happy.

## User pins

Add tasks here as `- [ ] description`. The agent takes the first unchecked one. Check it off
(`- [x]`) once its PR merges, or delete it.

- [ ] (no pins yet)

## Run history

Newest on top. The agent appends one entry per run. It tallies the `Category:` of the last 7
entries to decide the least-recently-worked category for cold-path selection.

Format:
```
### <YYYY-MM-DD> — <Category> — <Status>
- PR: <link or #num> (or "skipped" / "none")
- Source: <plan:ready/NNNN | pin | roadmap:#N | resume>
- Summary: <one line>
```

### 2026-06-05 — analysis — ready-for-review
- PR: https://github.com/wcalhoun516/digital-dad/pull/7
- Source: plan:ready/0004
- Summary: Track Record verdict backfill (plan 0004 **step 1**, the last step — completes the
  plan). New `analysis/verdict_backfill.py` — evidence-augmented grounded-verdict pass with
  injectable `gather_evidence` + `chat` seams (resumable, saves every N), TDD'd offline with
  30 tests. Adjudication precedence now `human > evidence > llm > status`; dashboard surfaces
  grounded verdicts + numbered source links + an "evidence-grounded" badge. Owner-gated
  `make backfill-verdicts` refuses to run when the conductor is down (paid T3). Conductor was
  **down** this run, so the live paid backfill was not executed — built + verified the
  machinery only. Plan 0004 moved to `plans/done/`.

### 2026-06-04 — analysis — ready-for-review
- PR: https://github.com/wcalhoun516/digital-dad/pull/6
- Source: plan:ready/0004
- Summary: Track Record human-adjudication layer (plan 0004 steps 2-4). New
  `analysis/adjudicate.py` — status precedence (human > llm > status), `apply_adjudication`
  writeback, resumable `python -m analysis.adjudicate` CLI + `make adjudicate`, TDD'd with 24
  tests. Dashboard now lets a family ruling win (family-confirmed marker). Deepened with
  confidence calibration (`calibration_report` + `conviction_boards`, `--report`, roadmap #12).
  Plan 0004 left in `ready/` — step 1 (web-search verdict backfill) is a future run.

### 2026-06-03 — family — ready-for-review
- PR: https://github.com/wcalhoun516/digital-dad/pull/5
- Source: plan:ready/0003
- Summary: On This Day approval-gated delivery (approach 1, per D9). New
  `analysis/delivery.py` (recipient parsing + payload + dry-run, TDD'd with 14 tests),
  refactored `bin/create_gmail_draft.py` onto it with `--dry-run`, added
  `make send-on-this-day` owner approval gate + README docs. Plan moved to `plans/done/`.

### 2026-06-02 — infra — ready-for-review
- PR: https://github.com/wcalhoun516/digital-dad/pull/3
- Source: plan:ready/0002
- Summary: Added `.github/workflows/verify.yml` (runs `make lint`/`make test` on PRs + pushes
  to main, with a guard that fails loudly if 0001's make targets are missing) and a CI status
  badge in `README.md`. Plan moved to `plans/done/`.

### 2026-05-30 — infra — ready-for-review
- PR: https://github.com/wcalhoun516/digital-dad/pull/1
- Source: plan:ready/0001
- Summary: Added pytest + ruff dev deps, `tests/` scaffold with 27 characterization tests
  (scraper/analysis utils + corpus-fingerprint), and `make test/lint/fmt/verify`. Plan moved
  to `plans/done/`.
