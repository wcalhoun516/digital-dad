# Daily log

Working memory for the daily product-dev agent (`scripts/daily_routine_prompt.md`).

## How to add ideas

You have three ways to influence what the agent builds, in **priority order** (the agent
prefers earlier ones):

1. **Pre-baked plan (hot path, highest priority).** Drop a `NNNN-slug.md` implementation plan
   into [`plans/ready/`](plans/ready/). The agent executes the *oldest* one first via the
   `superpowers:executing-plans` skill, then moves it to `plans/done/`. Best for work you've
   already thought through.
2. **User pin (middle priority).** Add a line under `## User pins` below. The agent works the
   **first unchecked `[ ]`** pin. Best for "just do this next" without writing a full plan.
3. **Roadmap (cold path, lowest priority).** Add/raise an item in
   [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md). When there's no plan and no pin, the agent picks the
   least-recently-worked category and pulls the highest-priority item from it.

The agent opens **one small draft PR per day**, never merges, never pushes to `main`. Review
the PR during the day; merge it yourself if you're happy.

## User pins

Add tasks here as `- [ ] description`. The agent takes the first unchecked one. Check it off
(`- [x]`) once its PR merges, or delete it.

- [ ] (no pins yet)

## Run history

Newest on top. The agent appends one entry per run. It tallies the `Category:` of the last 7
entries to decide the least-recently-worked category for cold-path selection.

Format:
```
### <YYYY-MM-DD> — <Category> — <Status>
- PR: <link or #num> (or "skipped" / "none")
- Source: <plan:ready/NNNN | pin | roadmap:#N | resume>
- Summary: <one line>
```
